# Langchain Go Example - Gemini prompt

Example that uses LangChainGo to run a simple prompt with Gemini.

## Setup

### Gemini API

You will need an Google Gemini key. You can pretty much sign into this with your Google account and
use that.  So far its been free!  But this is not a terribly taxing example.
Set this in the `.env` file.

Create a `.env` file with the following content:

```bash
API_KEY=xyz
```
