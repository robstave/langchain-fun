# Langchain Demos

![image](gopher.jpeg)

Some demos and exercises that explore [Langchain Go](https://tmc.github.io/langchaingo/docs/).

My orginal goal was to play with some AI tools and see how they worked.  I was also interested in the vector database side of things.  I have a few ideas for some projects that might be interesting.
To be honest, I was thinking I was going to need to roll up my sleeves and dig into
some docs and coding to get this to work.  Turns out its just a few lines of code. So from there, I was sold on using Langchain go.  

Langchain is a framework for building applications with LLMs.  It has a lot of support for different models and vector databases. These are all snippets and gists that I plan on using for further projects and knowledge transfer to other folks at work.

You will need an API for most if not all of this.
I skipped out on my dunkin doughnuts coffee for a week and what I saved has lasted me since 2024.
Your milage may vary.  

You can also sign up for an API with Google Gemini. <https://aistudio.google.com/>  
This seems to be free and generous.

## Vector db search with Langchain and ChromaDB

The first experiment was to see how easy it was to set up a vector database and push and pull data from it.  

Pretty much the same demo as the langchaingo.  Comes in two flavors.

[Chroma demo with open ai](./vector-chroma/readme.md).
[Chroma demo with Gemini](./vector-chroma-gemini/readme.md).

## Generate from a simple prompt

[Simple Prompt with Gemini](./gemini-example-simple/readme.md).

Just a simple prompt to see how it works.
